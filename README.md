# Power-BI-Dashboard
1. I used sales data of different products to make my dashbaoard.
2. I used cards to indicate overall estimate of proifts, revenues etc.
3. I used column bar charts to represent revenue by products.
4. I used maps to represent the profit earned by different countries.
5. The other components I used include slicer, table, pie chart, etc.
